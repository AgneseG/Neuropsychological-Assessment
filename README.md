# Neuropsychological-Assessment

This repository has been created to give an overview of my project at UMC (Utrecht Medical Center).

As I've been working on raw JSON data that are linked to personal patients' information, these cannot be shared, as well as the final .csv files with the new outcome measures created. 

As there was a single JSON file for each patient and for each test (190 patients, 17 tests), the first step was to extract useful information from the JSON data into CSV files.
From there, analyses have followed using RStudio.

Results have been summarised as to be presented to the neuropsychologists working at the project as both .csv files and .pptx files with useful visualisations.
